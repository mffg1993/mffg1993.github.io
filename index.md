In 2011, I commenced my studies at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology, which greatly influenced my career for several years. Interestingly, I have a tendency to pursue endeavors that are outside my natural strengths. This may have been the primary motivation for me to choose Physics as my major, with a later specialization in Optics, which might seem like a joke to some, especially considering my high school background.
